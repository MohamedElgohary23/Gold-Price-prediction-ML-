Several different factors can affect gold prices. These factors include the SPX (stands for The Standard and Poor's 500 index), silver price, EUR/USD - Euro to US dollar exchange ratio, and
USO - stands for "The United States Oil Fund Â® LP (USO)". It is an exchange-traded security whose shares may be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca
